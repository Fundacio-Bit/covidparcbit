The Regional Ministry of Economic Model, Tourism and Labour has designed a questionnaire for workers to fill it prior to their incorporation into their jobs.

The information must be sent, by the telematic means allowed by current legislation, to the occupational risk prevention services and, optionally, to the Social Security collaborating mutual insurance companies. Once the data contained in each of the questionnaires have been assessed, the prevention service or the mutual society must act according to the protocol published by the Ministry of Health (the latest updated version of this protocol) in the case of possible, confirmed or probable cases.
