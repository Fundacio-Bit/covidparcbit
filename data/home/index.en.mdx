Fundaci√≥ Bit has developed this guide in order to provide users of ParcBit with the guidelines to follow in terms of hygiene and safety, access points and use of common areas.

It is intended, all together, to make ParcBit a safe space, appealing to the responsibility of each of us to ensure the safety of all. A communication channel has been set up in Telegram where all the news and changes around COVID-19 will be reported.

The Regional Ministry of Economic Model, Tourism and Labour has designed a questionnaire for workers to fill in prior to their incorporation into jobs. The questionnaire is attached so that it can be used by all its workers.

All companies are urged to spread these measures among their employees.
